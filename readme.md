Developing a RESTful API with Node.js, Docker Desktop, MongoDB, and Postman.  
The service prompt the user with a username and a password, which are stored in the database with an email (psw is hashed with the library bcryptjs).  
Here are some screenshots of the job done; if you wish to ask questions, Iâ€™m glad to answer them.
